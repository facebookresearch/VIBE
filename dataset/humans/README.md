# Information for human models
The contained ```.json``` file lists out the human models' names, their body measurements (in centimeters), and an image url of their full-body appearance. 

## Example entry in json
```
"Alex": {"height": "174.0", 
         "bust": "81.0", 
         "waist": "64.0", 
         "hips": "91.0", 
         "url": "https://birdsnest-images.imgix.net/system/images/0450/8487/2016-05-24-Birdsnest-D2-S45-BIRDK-09-BLACK-024AAA.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.4&auto=format%2Ccompress&q=75&w=423"}
```

Note: We used multiple images for each human model in our project. More images of the human models can be found on the website [birdsnest](https://birdsnest.com).
